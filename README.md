# Online Course Recommendation
A website which recommends online courses from multiple sources, like coursera, udemy, based on provided job descriptions.

## Motivation
This idea is inspired from my personal experience with job hunting. It is important for job seekers to know what skills a position needs or a company needs as a software enginner and this would help them know what they should prepare. During the time of job hunting, I used to collect all the job descriptions posted from interested companies, go through all the required skills listed out there and get started to pick up them by learning from online courses like Coursera, Udemy and so on. Learning from online courses might not make you proficient with a skill but that is a good start point.

I believe there are many people doing the same thing like I did but the process of collecting skills in job descriptions and searching online courses from websites is not quite easy. That is what our project would like to opitimize...

## Functionality
User submits a job description and the website will list out recommended online courses for each skill order by its frequency
