# Online Course Recommendation
A website which recommends online courses from multiple sources, like coursera, udemy, based on provided job descriptions.

# Why we do this project
This idea is coming from my personal experience with job hunting. It is important for job seekers to know about what skills a position needs or a company needs as a software enginner so that they are able to know what or how to prepare. During the time of job hunting, I used to collect all the job descriptions posted from interested companies, go through all the required skills listed out there and get started to pick up them by learning from online courses like Coursera, Udemy and so on. Learning from online courses might not make you proficient with a skill but that is a good start point.

I believe there are many people doing the same thing like I did but the process from collecting skills in job descriptions to searching online courses from websites is not quite easy. that is what our project would like to opitimize..
